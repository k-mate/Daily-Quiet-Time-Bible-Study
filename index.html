<b><b>JOSHUA 7—8: DEFEAT, CONFESSION AND VICTORY</b></b>
</p>

<p>
For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to
the book of Joshua.
</p>

<p>
Success can lead to complacency. We feel confident, in control,
optimistic—then suddenly the bottom drops out of our lives. Israel had
tasted success. They had entered the Promised Land, they had won an
important battle, and God was obviously with them. Conquering the city
of Ai would be a piece of cake! But their confidence collapsed when
they attacked the city and were routed. What had gone wrong? Had God
failed them? Why hadn't God kept his promise?

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>He is concerned that Israel will be delivered to the enemies' hands</li>
<li>What then will happen to the Name of the Lord if they are wiped out</li>
</ol></li>

<li>How do God's concerns differ from Joshua's (7:10-15)?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>God is concerned that Israel has violated the covenant they have
with him</li>

<li>They have stolen, they have lied&#x2026; That is why they cannot stand
against their enemies</li>

<li>God wants a people consecrated to him</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Joshua urged Achan to "give glory to the LORD" by admitting his
crime (7:19). How does confession glorify God?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Confession to God is admitting that we have sinned against him</li>

<li>By confessing we acknowledge he is God</li>
</ol></li>

<li>How did the second attack on Ai differ from the first (8:1-29)?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The enemy was completely defeated</li>
</ol></li>

<li>If you had been an Israelite, what thoughts would have come to mind
each time you saw the rock piles mentioned in 7:26 and 8:29?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It would remind them that they have to obey God and not break the
covenant</li>

<li>The other pile would remind them that God is with them and His
presence will help them conquer the Promised Land</li>
</ol></li>

<li>What impact would the reading of the law have had on the Israelites
(8:32-35)?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>God wants to make sure that the law is heard and will be
remembered for all time to come since it has been carved in stone</li>

<li>Public reading of the law also reiterates it once again how
serious God is about his law</li>

<b><b>JOHN 2: WINE &amp; A WHIP</b></b>
</p>

<p>
For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to the book
of John.
</p>

<p>
After I had given a presentation on the claims of Christ, a skeptical student
asked: "What proof do you have that Jesus really was who he claimed to be?"
People have been asking that question for two thousand years! For John the
convincing proof of Jesus’ deity was found in his words and deeds. No one but
God could say the things Jesus said, and no one but God could do the things
Jesus did. In this chapter are two signs that demonstrate that Jesus was the
fullness of God clothed in humanity.

<li>When the groom's parents ran out of wine for their guests, Jesus' mother
 asked him to help (v. 3). What do you think Mary expected Jesus to do?
(Remember, according to verse 11 Jesus had not yet performed any miracles.)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Running out of wine would have been an embarassment for the host in this
case</li>
<li>Mary knew Jesus was a miracle child&#x2026; But did she really expect Jesus to
do a miracle? I dont think so.</li>
<li>Or, perhaps she already knew Jesus' ability to perform a miracle and that
is why she asked Jesus to help</li>
</ul></li>

<li>What did Jesus mean by his reply to Mary in verse 4?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>His hour has not yet come according to Jesus</li>

<li>I dont understand the passage here, because Jesus anyway helped and turned
water into wine</li>
</ul></li>

<li>According to verse 11, the purpose of Jesus' miracle was not to save the groom
from embarrassment but to display Christ's glory. What aspects of Christ's
glory does this miracle reveal to you?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He can use simple things to do great things</li>

<li>To make it more personal, God save a sinner like me to be salt to the world</li>

<li>Jesus have zeal for the house of the Lord. In today's popular concept of
him, He was a great teacher who was not afraid to speak out against injustice
in the world.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Only the Messiah had the authority to cleanse the temple. The people
recognized that and asked Jesus for a miraculous sign to confirm his identity
(v. 18). To what "sign" did Jesus point them (vv. 19-22)? Why do you think
that particular sign was so significant in Jesus' mind?
<ul class="org-ul">

of his ministry, he was clear of the path he was to take</li>

<b><b>JOHN 1: THE MASTER &amp; FIVE WHO FOLLOWED</b></b>
</p>

<p>
For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to the book of John. 
</p>

<p>
It was a great day in our history when a man first walked on the moon. But the Bible declares that a far greater event took place two thousand years ago. God walked on the earth in the person of Jesus Christ. John opens his Gospel with a beautiful hymn of exaltation to Christ. It is one of the most profound passages in all the Bible. It is written in simple, straightforward language, yet in studying the depths of its meaning, it is a passage where we never reach bottom. It is an ocean-sized truth, and we have to be content to paddle around in shallow water.

<li>What steps did John take to guarantee that people would not look at him but at Christ?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Someone was to come after him, he cried</li>
<li>He denied being the Messiah</li>
<li>He testified about Jesus as the Messiah</li>
</ol></li>

<li>In verses 35-51 we are introduced to five men: Andrew, Simon, Philip, Nathanael and one unnamed disciple (John). How did each man respond to the testimony he heard about Jesus?
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Andrew searched for his brother Simon and introduced him to Jesus the Messiah</li>

<li>Philip told Nathanael that he found the Messiah</li>

<li>Nathanael declared to Jesus that he was the Messiah</li>

<li>John, the writer, wants to tell us upfront that Jesus is the Messiah</li>
</ol></li>
