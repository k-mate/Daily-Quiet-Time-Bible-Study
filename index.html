<b><b>JOSHUA 14—18: JOSHUA DIVIDES THE LAND</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Christians often feel more like captives than conquerors. What hinders
our spiritual progress? Why do we sometimes experience so little when
we are promised so much? God had proven himself to Israel throughout
their many battles. He had promised to be with them in the conquest of
Canaan and had kept his promise. Yet in spite of many victories, much
of the land remained to be conquered. These chapters look at why
Israel had failed to possess all that God had promised.

<p>
Note 15:63, 16:10 and 17:12-13. God had promised to drive these

<b><b>JOSHUA 10—12: THE LORD FIGHTS FOR ISRAEL</b></b>
</p>

<p>
For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to
the book of Joshua.
</p>

<p>
God demonstrates his faithfulness to every Christian. He strengthens
us when we are weak, comforts us when we are suffering, heals us when
we are sick. He provides for all of our physical, emotional and
spiritual needs. After all this, why do we often find it difficult to
trust him? Joshua and Israel had miraculously crossed the Jordan and
conquered the cities of Jericho and Ai. Yet in spite of these
victories, they still needed to be reassured that God was with them.

The Lord tells Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them; I have given them
into your hand" (10:8). After miraculously crossing the Jordan and
conquering Jericho and Ai,why would Joshua need this reassurance?
</p>

<p>
Verse 14 concludes, "Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!" How is
this obvious from 10:9-15?
</p>

<p>
After the Lord reassures him, how does Joshua reassure his army about
future battles (10:16-27)?
</p>

<p>
How does the Lord demonstrate his faithfulness to Israel during the
southern campaign (10:29-43)?
</p>

<p>
During the northern campaign, how does Joshua demonstrate his
obedience to the Lord (11:6-23)?
</p>

<p>
In chapters 11—12 we do not read of any miraculous intervention by God
as we did in previous chapters. How did the Israelites know that God
was still the one giving them the victory?

Satan's primary strategy is deceit. He seduces us into believing that
a lie is truth, that evil is good and that a "suicidal plunge is
really a leap into life" (Derek Kidner, Genesis [Downers Grove, IL:
InterVarsity Press, 1967], p. 68).

the book of Joshua.

<p>
Success can lead to complacency. We feel confident, in control,
optimistic—then suddenly the bottom drops out of our lives. Israel had
tasted success. They had entered the Promised Land, they had won an
important battle, and God was obviously with them. Conquering the city
of Ai would be a piece of cake! But their confidence collapsed when
they attacked the city and were routed. What had gone wrong? Had God
failed them? Why hadn't God kept his promise?

<b><b>JOHN 2: WINE &amp; A WHIP</b></b>
</p>

<p>
For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to the book
of John.
</p>

<p>
After I had given a presentation on the claims of Christ, a skeptical student
asked: "What proof do you have that Jesus really was who he claimed to be?"
People have been asking that question for two thousand years! For John the
convincing proof of Jesus’ deity was found in his words and deeds. No one but
God could say the things Jesus said, and no one but God could do the things
Jesus did. In this chapter are two signs that demonstrate that Jesus was the
fullness of God clothed in humanity.

</p>

<p>
For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to the book of John. 
</p>

<p>
It was a great day in our history when a man first walked on the moon. But the Bible declares that a far greater event took place two thousand years ago. God walked on the earth in the person of Jesus Christ. John opens his Gospel with a beautiful hymn of exaltation to Christ. It is one of the most profound passages in all the Bible. It is written in simple, straightforward language, yet in studying the depths of its meaning, it is a passage where we never reach bottom. It is an ocean-sized truth, and we have to be content to paddle around in shallow water.
