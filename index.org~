**JOHN 7:1-52: CONFUSION OVER CHRIST**

 Not long ago I had a series of conversations with a young man about
 Jesus Christ and why faith in him is so important. At first, the
 young man was interested. He was open to listen to God’s Word and to
 consider Christ’s claims. As time went on, however, he became more
 and more hostile to Christ. Finally, he told me that he didn’t want
 to pursue his investigation any further. He had decided to reject
 Christ and his offer of salvation.

 That is precisely the pattern that John traces in his Gospel. In the
 early chapters, men and women responded to Jesus with belief. Then
 some of those who were following him turned away. Now open warfare
 breaks out between Jesus and his enemies—and yet, some still seek the
 truth. This chapter will help you respond positively to the wide
 variety of attitudes toward Jesus today.

** Warming Up to God

  "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink." These are
  Jesus’ words to us today. In what way do you need Jesus’ spiritual
  refreshment? Be quiet before him and experience the "streams of
  living water."

  Read John 7:1-52

** Discovering the Word

**The first blast of hostility against Jesus comes from his own family (vv. 1-13). How would you characterize the statements made by Jesus' brothers (vv. 3-5)?**

**When Jesus makes his presence in Jerusalem known, people begin to challenge the origin (and, therefore, the authority) of his teaching. According to Jesus, how can we verify the truth of his teaching (vv. 16-18)?**

**What other opinions or questions do people have about Jesus in verses 20-36?**

**How does Jesus respond to each one?**
  
**On the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, large vats of water were poured out on the pavement of the temple court as a reminder of God's provision of water in the wilderness. With that custom in mind, how would you explain the significance of Jesus' remarks in verses 37-39?**

** Applying the Word

**What counsel would you give a believer who faces spiritual opposition from his or her family?**

**Which of the opinions about Jesus you have identified in this chapter are still expressed today, and in what way?**

**Based on Jesus' example, what should our response be to such reactions?**

** Responding in Prayer

**Pray for wisdom as you face various reactions to Jesus.**

**JOHN 6: JESUS, THE BREAD OF LIFE**

 Do you realize that during your lifetime you will probably spend over
 thirty-five thousand hours eating? That's the equivalent of eight
 years of nonstop meals, twelve hours a day! The problem, of course,
 is that even after a big meal we get hungry again. At best, food only
 satisfies us for a few hours.

 Yet in this chapter, Jesus offers us food that satisfies our hunger
 forever. You can't buy it in a grocery store. It is found only in
 Jesus himself.
 
** Warming Up to God
  
**How do you usually respond to an "impossible" situation—a problem in your life that doesn't seem to have a solution?**

In such situations, I have prayed to God and help me get through. I
was very disappointed once that my prayers were not answered (as I
thought). I questioned a lot about life, God and his will. It was not
easy having been through. I thought I could have just helped myself
instead of asking God to help me. It made me very angry with everything. 

  [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206&version=NIV&interface=print][Read John 6]]
  
** Discovering the Word

**Read John 6:1-15. How would you characterize Philip's and Andrew's response to the problem of feeding this enormous crowd (vv. 5-9)?**

Philip was practical in his response by saying that it will cost half a year's wage to give a bite to the people.

Andrew offered a very small solution that there was a small boy with five loaves and two fish, but impossible for the people to be fed.

Both knows the situation is impossible. Andrew goes a little bit further in offering something rather than nothing.


**Imagine that you are one of the disciples, rowing the boat in dark, rough waters (vv. 16-21). How would your concept of Jesus have been altered by seeing him walk on water?**

**The next day the people were hungry again, so they came seeking Jesus (vv. 22-25). How does he try to redirect their thinking (vv. 26-33)?**

**Based on the remarks of some in the crowd (vv. 41-42), do you think they finally understood what Jesus was saying? Explain.**

**When Jesus said, "This bread is my flesh," the crowd could think only of cannibalism (v. 52). What do you think it means to eat Jesus' flesh and drink his blood (vv. 53-59)? Is this something we do once for all time, or is it an ongoing process? Explain.**

**In verses 60-71 Jesus turns away from the crowd and focuses on his disciples. How would you describe their responses to his "hard teaching"?**

** Applying the Word

**Which response in question 6 best describes your present attitude toward Jesus? Explain.**

**Jesus has contrasted the two appetites found in every person—the appetite for food that perishes and the appetite for food that endures. In what ways has Jesus satisfied the spiritual hunger in your heart?**

** Responding in Prayer

**Praise God for satisfying all your needs.**

**JOSHUA 24: WHO WILL SERVE THE LORD?**

Throughout the book of Joshua the Lord has demonstrated his
faithfulness and his power. Every promise he made was fulfilled; every
battle he fought was won. Now at the conclusion of the book he asks
Israel and us to reaffirm the most important decision of our lives:
"Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve" (v. 15).

** Warming Up to God

 God has given us the ability to make choices. What are some of the
 inherent benefits and dangers of this freedom for you?

 [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2024&version=NIV&interface=print][Read Joshua 24]]

**  Discovering the Word

**Why do you think the Lord recounts Israel's history from beginning to end (vv. 1-13)?**
- It recounts Israel's journey from their ancestor of long ago,
  Abraham to the day they possessed the Promised Land.
- How God has been faithful in keeping his promises to Abraham, Issac
  and Israel
 
**Joshua and the Israelites repeat the word serve thirteen times in verses 14-27. Why is this a good word to describe our duty to God?**
- Either we serve the Lord or serve someone/something else. It is ours
  to choose whom we serve.
- Our duty is to serve and obey the Lord. We are his servants. What
  better word than "serve" to describe our duty to Him.

**Why might serving the Lord seem undesirable to the Israelites (v. 15)?**
- Serving the Lord might seem undesirable as the grass seems to be
  greener on the other side. When Israel sees the gods of their past
  and of their present neighbors, they might think it seems more
  desirable to serve other gods.

**Why doesn't Joshua accept the Israelites' first pledge to serve the Lord (v. 19)?**
- Joshua is reminding them that serving the Lord is not easy. In fact
  we are not able to since He is a holy God, jealous God and will not
  forgive our rebellion and sins if we forsake him.
- He wants to make sure that the people really meant what they say
  about serving the Lord


**What is the purpose of the witnesses mentioned in verses 22 and 27?**
- Witness is a reminder that we have made promise to God. It helps us
  not to stray away from the path we have chosen to take

**  Applying the Word

**Israel must choose whom they will serve (v. 15). What choices to you have about whom to serve?**
- We also have a choice today: money, career, or perhaps
  entertainment. We need all these in life, but we can go to the
  extent that we value them or keep them above God. And as Christians,
  that is not the right choice.
 
**In what ways is serving the Lord difficult for you?**
- Serving the Lord is difficult for me due to temptations, the desires
  of the flesh and weaknesses.

 
**What makes serving him worthwhile?**
- Serving him is most worthwhile because there is nothing greater than
  serving God. If we are seeking to find purpose in our lives then, it
  is serving God.

**  Responding in Prayer

**Pray that God will give you courage to rise to the challenge of Joshua—to obey God more fully.**

Lord help me to always remember to serve you. There is nothing worth
more than to serve the living God, the one and only true God.

**JOSHUA 22: WILL THE NATION SURVIVE?**

For more context before you begin studying, read this [[https://www.ivpress.com/daily-bible-study/introducing-joshua][introduction to
the book of Joshua.]]

The tribes which had been given land on the east side of the Jordan
had fulfilled their commitment to the rest of Israel. They had entered
the Promised Land with the others and had helped them to fight. Now it
was time for them to return to their own homes. But since the
Israelites would be living on both sides of the river, the Jordan Rift
Valley became a natural barrier which hindered the unity of the twelve
tribes. Could Israel still remain unified? Their response to a
national crisis illustrates principles for maintaining Christian
unity.

** Warming Up to God

 God is glorified by your praise and worship. Spend some time offering
 your thanks for who he is.

 [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2022&version=NIV&interface=print][Read Joshua 22]]

**  Discovering the Word

**Why does Joshua commend the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh (vv. 1-4)?**
- They were commended for doing all that Moses had commanded them to do in carrying out the mission the Lord had given them (to conquer the land).

**What blessings had these tribes received from God because of their faithful service (vv. 6-9)?**
- They returned to their homes with great wealth

**Why were the western tribes prepared to do battle over the issue of the altar (vv. 10-20; see also Deut 12:1-14)?**
- They thought the tribes across the Jordan had rebelled against the Lord by building an altar for themselves. The Lord had not tolerated sin in the lives of Israel. So they wanted to root out the evil from their midst.

 
**What reasons did the eastern tribes have for building the altar (vv. 21-29)?**
- The eastern tribes replied that their intention was quite the opposite of building an altar for themselves. The altar was to be a reminder to them and the western tribes that the eastern tribes also have a share in the Lord. The altar was a replica of the Lord to stand as witness that they also have share in the Lord.

**How did both sides in this dispute show that they were honoring God (vv. 30-34)?**
- This incident shows that both sides are jealous for the Lord. Both their intentions are to follow the commandments of the Lord.
 
** Applying the Word

**What can we learn from this story about confronting those whose actions seem offensive?**
- We should first learn from the other person before coming to a conclusion. The intentions of the other party could be quite good though it may appear contrary to us.
 
**What should our attitude be toward those who have misunderstood our actions?**
- It is our duty to explain clearly our position and what our actions will achieve when we are misunderstood.
 
**What principles do you find in this chapter for restoring and maintaining unity in your church or fellowship group?**
- Two opposing parties or views should see the other's point of view and not take things too personally and resolve conflicts. Everyone working for the Lord have the best intentions for the Lord. If we are wrong, we should also be willing to admit that we have been wrong. 

** Responding in Prayer

**Pray that God would bring unity to his church around the world.**
- I pray for my church that there will be perfect unity. That all of us will be working for the Lord. Satan should not take control of our thoughts, words and actions to destroy unity in the church.

How does faith differ from wishful thinking? Why should we expect God
to answer our prayers, to provide us with food and clothing, or to be
involved in jobs or family? How do we know our faith isn't simply
foolishness? Scripture tells us that true faith must be grounded in
God's promises. If God has promised to do something, then we can trust
him wholeheartedly. If he has not promised to do something, then all
the faith in the world won't make it happen. In Joshua 20—21 we see
the final outcome of God's promises to Israel.

Warming Up to God

Think of a time recently when you trusted God for something. Which of
his promises applied to that situation?

Phatchesa a Pathen na kingaina ipi um em? Aman Bible a akitepna toh kitoh ipi um am?

Read Joshua 20-21

What does the command to establish these cities teach us about the Lord?

Levi phung mite chu phungdang toh akikheh nau ipi ham (see 13:14, 33; 14:3-4; 18:7)?
How did the Levites differ from the other tribes (see 13:14, 33; 14:3-4; 18:7)?

What do you think God's purpose was in scattering the Levites throughout the land?

How does 21:43-45 provide the climax to the book of Joshua?

What are some of the promises God has made to us as Christians?

In what ways have you seen God fulfill these promises in your life?

Responding in Prayer

Praise God for his faithfulness in keeping his promises to us.

**JOHN 4: SOUL & BODY—SAVINGS & HEALING**

"I love humanity; it's people I can’t stand!" Those well-known words
from a member of the "Peanuts" gang still make us chuckle. But our
smiles hide the fact that we sometimes feel exactly like that. John
says very little about Jesus’ contact with the multitudes. But long
sections of the Gospel are devoted to conversations Jesus had with
individuals. In John 4 we see Jesus reach out first to a woman, then
to his disciples, and finally to a grieving father. Watching Jesus
give himself to people with love and compassion will help us care for
those God puts in our paths.

** Warming Up to God

 When have you recently felt that you were being mobbed by the
 multitudes? Ask God to help you to take care of yourself even as you
 try to help others.

 Read John 4

** Discovering the Word

 What is surprising about Jesus’ question to the Samaritan woman
 (vv. 8-9)?
 - Jews don't associate with Samaritans. That's why a Jew (Jesus)
   asking a drink from the Samaritan woman was surprising.

 Why does the woman suddenly change the subject and begin talking
 about the controversy over the proper place of worship (vv. 16-20)?
- From her conversation with Jesus, she came to know something special
  about Jesus since he told her about her life

- Therefore, she changed the topic to spiritual aspects of life

 From verses 27-42, do you think the Samaritan woman genuinely
  believed? What do you see in the passage that supports your
  position?
- She told her townsmen about Jesus. She believed that Jesus is the
  Messiah because Jesus said so and also everything about her life.

 After his encounter with the Samaritan woman, what specific lessons
  does Jesus apply to his disciples and to us (vv. 34-38)?
- The harvest is ready, the fields are ripe now
- The job at hand for the disciples is to go to the field and reap the
  harvest

 What does the "second miraculous sign" Jesus performs (vv. 43-54)
  reveal about him?
- He is the Messiah, Saviour of the world.

** Applying the Word

 What has Jesus taught you in this chapter about meeting the specific
 needs of those around you?
 - There are people who are neglected and despised around us. As
   Christ did, we are to reach out to them

 What present-day situations might arouse the same racial, religious
 and sexual prejudices as the Samaritan woman did?
 - There are many situations based on race, religion and sexual
   prejudices in present day people face discrimination

 How could you reach someone who has been rejected by the world, as
 Jesus did?
 - Tell them Jesus loves and cares for them

** Responding in Prayer

 Ask God to help you be aware of the "Samaritans" around you. Ask him
 to help you reach out to them.

**JOSHUA 14—18: JOSHUA DIVIDES THE LAND**

Christians often feel more like captives than conquerors. What hinders
our spiritual progress? Why do we sometimes experience so little when
we are promised so much? God had proven himself to Israel throughout
their many battles. He had promised to be with them in the conquest of
Canaan and had kept his promise. Yet in spite of many victories, much
of the land remained to be conquered. These chapters look at why
Israel had failed to possess all that God had promised.

** Warming Up to God

In what one area of your life would you most like to see spiritual
progress?

- Ka lhagao hinkho a ka lhasamna tah khat chu Taona ahi. Bible jong ka

How is Caleb's faith just as strong at eighty-five as it had been at
forty?
- Caleb in kum somget le nga jouvin jong, a thahat nalai in, Pathen in

- Kum tam leh lhom thu ahipoi. Ama thahat le hatlou thu jong ahipoi. A
  Pathen thahatna a akingai jeh ahi.

Note 15:63, 16:10 and 17:12-13. God had promised to drive these
Canaanites out of the land. Why then do you think Israel had
difficulty dislodging them (see also Ex 23:29-30 and Dt 7:22-24)?
- Pathen in a thutepna chu ahileh, a gam a ana chengte chu a nodoh

How does the attitude of the people of Joseph contrast with that of

- Phung sagi ho chu gam alo theilou nailou u ahi. A mite chu a nodoh u

As you look back over these chapters, what reasons can you give for
why Israel had difficulty taking full possession of the land?
- A gam a umte chu a vet uleh, a kichat jeh uvin, gam chu abon in alo

Which reasons help to explain why God's promises to us are sometimes
only partially fulfilled? (For example, his promise to purify our
lives of sin.) Explain.

We sometimes act like the people of Joseph, complaining about how
little God has given us when we have not fully used what we have. How
do you think Joshua would respond to our complaints and excuses?
- Joseph phung ho bang a, ka chanding bang ka chang poi tia phunnoi

**JOSHUA 10—12: THE LORD FIGHTS FOR ISRAEL**

For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to
the book of Joshua.

God demonstrates his faithfulness to every Christian. He strengthens
us when we are weak, comforts us when we are suffering, heals us when
we are sick. He provides for all of our physical, emotional and
spiritual needs. After all this, why do we often find it difficult to
trust him? Joshua and Israel had miraculously crossed the Jordan and
conquered the cities of Jericho and Ai. Yet in spite of these
victories, they still needed to be reassured that God was with them.

** Warming Up to God

Why is it often hard to trust God for the future even though he has
been faithful in the past?

[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2010-12&version=NIV&interface=print][Read Joshua 10-12]]

**  Discovering the Word

The Lord tells Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them; I have given them
into your hand" (10:8). After miraculously crossing the Jordan and
conquering Jericho and Ai,why would Joshua need this reassurance?

Verse 14 concludes, "Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!" How is
this obvious from 10:9-15?

After the Lord reassures him, how does Joshua reassure his army about
future battles (10:16-27)?

How does the Lord demonstrate his faithfulness to Israel during the
southern campaign (10:29-43)?

During the northern campaign, how does Joshua demonstrate his
obedience to the Lord (11:6-23)?

In chapters 11—12 we do not read of any miraculous intervention by God
as we did in previous chapters. How did the Israelites know that God
was still the one giving them the victory?
 
** Applying the Word

What can we do to encourage others about God's faithfulness?

Why is our obedience an important factor if we wish to see God's
power?

In spite of past victories, in what areas do you need to be reassured
of God's presence and power? Explain.
 
** Responding in Prayer

Pray that God would make his presence real to you.

**JOSHUA 9: DECEIVED**

For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to
the book of Joshua.

Satan's primary strategy is deceit. He seduces us into believing that
a lie is truth, that evil is good and that a "suicidal plunge is
really a leap into life" (Derek Kidner, Genesis [Downers Grove, IL:
InterVarsity Press, 1967], p. 68).

** Warming Up to God

- How do you decide whether to make a decision on your own or to pray
  about it first?
  1. It is always safer to pray about decisions that we take in life
  2. The bigger the decision, the more I would like to ask God about it
  3. At times, it feels like indecision, but it is better to know we
     are walking in the right path after having spent enough time in
     prayer

  [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%209&version=NIV&interface=print][Read Joshua 9]]

** Discovering the Word

- When they hear about Israel's victories, how does the Gibeonites'
  reaction differ from that of the kings west of the Jordan (vv. 1-6)?
  1. The other kings came up against the Israelites whereas the
     Gibeonites came up with a deceitful plan to make peace with
     Israel
  2. They know the God of Israel

- What made the Gibeonites' deception so convincing to the Israelites
  (vv. 7-13)?
  1. They came with torn clothes, worn out sandals, dry and moldy
     bread which made them appear as if they have traveled from a far
     away country

  2. The samples look convincing, they even asked them if they had
     come from a nearby place perhaps. Their mistake was they didn't
     equire of the Lord

- The Israelites were fooled because they "did not inquire of the
  LORD" (v. 14). Why should they have known that this was not a
  decision to be made on their own?
  1. Making treaty with a nation is a big decision that too in the
     Name of the Lord. It clearly requires of them to ask the Lord

- Why did the Israelites take their oath so seriously, even though it
  was based on a lie (vv. 16-19)?
  1. They have taken their oath in the Name of the Lord

- The Gibeonites are similar to Rahab in that, for both, their faith
  led them to lie (vv. 22-27). Why aren't the Gibeonites commended for
  their faith as Rahab was?
  1. Gibeonites decieve Israel whereas Rahab help Israel in its plan
     to conquer the land
  
** Applying the Word

 - What tricks does Satan use to keep us from seeking God's guidance?
   1. By making us fear but God has not given us a spirit of fear.
   2. Some well-meaning friends and family members will make things
      appear as if it is God-ordained and we will not seek on our own
      whether it is God's will

 - In what areas are we tempted to make peace with a sinful world?
   1. There are many areas... in career decisions, etc

** Responding in Prayer

Pray for those who are even now under Satan's deceitful influence.

**JOSHUA 7—8: DEFEAT, CONFESSION AND VICTORY**

For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to
the book of Joshua.

Success can lead to complacency. We feel confident, in control,
optimistic—then suddenly the bottom drops out of our lives. Israel had
tasted success. They had entered the Promised Land, they had won an
important battle, and God was obviously with them. Conquering the city
of Ai would be a piece of cake! But their confidence collapsed when
they attacked the city and were routed. What had gone wrong? Had God
failed them? Why hadn't God kept his promise?

** Warming Up to God

Think of a time when you failed at something. How did you feel, and why?

[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%207-8&version=NIV&interface=print][Read Joshua 7-8]]

**  Discovering the Word

- What are Joshua's concerns after this defeat (7:6-9)?
  1. He is concerned that Israel will be delivered to the enemies' hands
  2. What then will happen to the Name of the Lord if they are wiped out

- How do God's concerns differ from Joshua's (7:10-15)?
  1. God is concerned that Israel has violated the covenant they have
     with him

  2. They have stolen, they have lied... That is why they cannot stand
     against their enemies

  3. God wants a people consecrated to him

- Joshua urged Achan to "give glory to the LORD" by admitting his
  crime (7:19). How does confession glorify God?
  1. Confession to God is admitting that we have sinned against him

  2. By confessing we acknowledge he is God

- How did the second attack on Ai differ from the first (8:1-29)?
  1. The enemy was completely defeated

- If you had been an Israelite, what thoughts would have come to mind
  each time you saw the rock piles mentioned in 7:26 and 8:29?
  1. It would remind them that they have to obey God and not break the
     covenant

  2. The other pile would remind them that God is with them and His
     presence will help them conquer the Promised Land

- What impact would the reading of the law have had on the Israelites
  (8:32-35)?
  1. God wants to make sure that the law is heard and will be
     remembered for all time to come since it has been carved in stone

  2. Public reading of the law also reiterates it once again how
     serious God is about his law
 
** Applying the Word

- Joshua stated that Achan was being stoned because he had brought
  disaster on the Israelites (7:25). Thirty-six Israelite warriors had
  already died because of Achan's sin. How might our sins affect
  others?
  1. Our sins can affect not only us but some other innocent people
     directly or indirectly
  2. We need to be careful how we lead our lives, lest our actions can
     affect others

- What reminders can help keep us from sinning?
  1. By learning the word, having his words in our homes so that we
     are always reminded

  2. Take great care to know that God punishes sin. He wants a people
     consecrated to him
  
** Responding in Prayer

-  Bring any sin in your life before God. Confess it to him with a
  penitent heart.

**JOHN 2: WINE & A WHIP**

For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to the book
of John.

After I had given a presentation on the claims of Christ, a skeptical student
asked: "What proof do you have that Jesus really was who he claimed to be?"
People have been asking that question for two thousand years! For John the
convincing proof of Jesus’ deity was found in his words and deeds. No one but
God could say the things Jesus said, and no one but God could do the things
Jesus did. In this chapter are two signs that demonstrate that Jesus was the
fullness of God clothed in humanity.

** Warming Up to God

 Thank God for revealing himself to you personally.

 [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202&version=NIV&interface=print][Read John 2]]

**  Discovering the Word

1. When the groom's parents ran out of wine for their guests, Jesus' mother
  asked him to help (v. 3). What do you think Mary expected Jesus to do?
 (Remember, according to verse 11 Jesus had not yet performed any miracles.)
   - Running out of wine would have been an embarassment for the host in this
     case
   - Mary knew Jesus was a miracle child... But did she really expect Jesus to
     do a miracle? I dont think so.
   - Or, perhaps she already knew Jesus' ability to perform a miracle and that
     is why she asked Jesus to help

2. What did Jesus mean by his reply to Mary in verse 4?
   - His hour has not yet come according to Jesus

   - I dont understand the passage here, because Jesus anyway helped and turned
     water into wine

3. According to verse 11, the purpose of Jesus' miracle was not to save the groom
  from embarrassment but to display Christ's glory. What aspects of Christ's
  glory does this miracle reveal to you?
   - He can use simple things to do great things

   - To make it more personal, God save a sinner like me to be salt to the world

4. How does John's picture of Jesus in verses 15-16 fit with today's popular
  concept of him?
  - Jesus have zeal for the house of the Lord. In today's popular concept of
    him, He was a great teacher who was not afraid to speak out against injustice
    in the world.

5. Only the Messiah had the authority to cleanse the temple. The people
  recognized that and asked Jesus for a miraculous sign to confirm his identity
  (v. 18). To what "sign" did Jesus point them (vv. 19-22)? Why do you think
  that particular sign was so significant in Jesus' mind?
  - He alluded to his resurrection on the third day here. So from the beginning
    of his ministry, he was clear of the path he was to take

** Applying the Word

1. In what practical ways can you demonstrate the same concern that Jesus does
  toward the holy character of God?
   - Just as Jesus was angry with people who take lightly the name of God and the
     Lord's temple, we need to have holy anger against the wrongs we see in our
     church, society and institutions

2. How do Jesus’ presence and actions at this party serve as a model for you?
   - In the world we live in, we are to live in a way that reveal God's glory

   - We may not be able to do miracle just as Jesus did, but we are God's
     representative and our concern is to bring glory to God in and through our
     speech and actions
  
** Responding in Prayer

   Ask God to help you to be his representative in everything you do.

**JOHN 1: THE MASTER & FIVE WHO FOLLOWED**

For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to the book of John. 

It was a great day in our history when a man first walked on the moon. But the Bible declares that a far greater event took place two thousand years ago. God walked on the earth in the person of Jesus Christ. John opens his Gospel with a beautiful hymn of exaltation to Christ. It is one of the most profound passages in all the Bible. It is written in simple, straightforward language, yet in studying the depths of its meaning, it is a passage where we never reach bottom. It is an ocean-sized truth, and we have to be content to paddle around in shallow water.

 Consider the miracle of God becoming human. Give him your praise and worship for what he has done for you.
