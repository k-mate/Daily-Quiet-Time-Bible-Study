<b><b>JOHN 10: THE SHEPHERD &amp; HIS SHEEP</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Jesus was a master at using simple, everyday objects or events to
illustrate profound spiritual truths. The farmer scattering seed, the
vine sustaining the branches, and sparrows falling to the earth all
took on a new dimension in Jesus’ eyes. In John 10, Jesus uses the
scene of a shepherd enclosing his sheep in a sheepfold to give us one
of the most moving pictures of our salvation and security in Christ
found anywhere in the Bible. If you’ve ever doubted the love of
Christ, Jesus will give you a healthy dose of assurance in this
chapter.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org25f991a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org25f991a">Warming Up to God</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org25f991a">
<p>
What usually prompts you to have doubts about your salvation or your
walk with Christ—your own sin? feelings of unworthiness? personal
failures? Be honest with Christ about your doubts.
</p>

<h3 id="orgd3e3f56">Discovering the Word</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3e3f56">
<p>
<b><b>What spiritual truths is Jesus trying to convey in verses 1-5?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Jesus is conveying in verses 1-5 that the Pharisees were like
thieves who come only to steal the sheep. The true shepherd
i.e. Jesus was, however, different from the Pharisees. He is
conveying here that he is the only way to the Father.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>In verses 11-15 Jesus talks about the shepherd’s care for his</b></b>
<b><b>sheep. What can you learn from those verses about Jesus’ care and</b></b>
<b><b>relationship with you?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Jesus laid down his life for me. He used the metaphor of a good
shepherd laying down his life for the sheep. The good shepherd
cares for his sheep to the extent of laying down his life for the
sheep.
</p>

<p>
The thief comes to steal. The hired worker also does not care
anything for the sheep.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>According to Jesus, how are the Jews in this passage different from his sheep (vv. 22-27)?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
The Jews are different from Jesus's sheep. The sheep hears his
voice and follows the shepherd. However the Jews were questioning
him and trying to stone him for his teaching. They were not his
sheep.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>When Jesus claims that he and the Father are one, the Jews pick up</b></b>
<b><b>stones to stone him (vv. 30-33). Do you think his defense is a</b></b>
<b><b>denial of his deity (vv. 33-36)? Explain.</b></b>
</p>

<p>
His defense quoting Psalm 82:6 says that we are all God's sons
seems to be denial of his deity. I am not sure what this passage is
talking about. I might have to dig deeper here using Bible
commentaries.

<p>
<b><b>How do you respond to promises and assurances Jesus gives his sheep in verses 28-29?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
None can snatch us from the hands of Jesus. None can snatch us out of his Father's hands.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Which promise from Jesus in this chapter is most encouraging to you? How can Jesus' promise help you when you have doubts?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
The fact that we are his sheep (since we have heard his voice) and
that nothing can snatch us from his hands assures us of our
salvation.

<b><b>1 TIMOTHY 4: TRUE AND FALSE MINISTRY</b></b>
</p>

<p>
For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to
the book of 1 Timothy.
</p>

<p>
With this chapter, Paul's strategy for Timothy starts to emerge
clearly. Timothy's mission was to deal with the false teachers. Paul
sees, however, that fighting false teachers with ideology alone is
fruitless. The real mission is that the church be healthy so that
Jesus Christ is communicated through it. So he spoke of prayer and
leadership first. With that foundation in place, Timothy will be able
to turn his attention directly to the problems at hand.

<b><b>1 TIMOTHY 3: WHO CAN LEAD?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
For more context before you begin studying, read this introduction to
the book of 1 Timothy.
</p>

<p>
Some churches and fellowships have a few people who are willing to
lead. Those people may end up feeling burdened and alone. Other
churches have people who are willing to lead, but not ready. If there
are not enough leaders, however, the work of the church will not get
done. The church of Ephesus was in the latter category. Those who
were willing to lead were immature. And Timothy could not hope to
carry out his mission against false teachers unless the leadership
was healthy.

<li>Ability to build rapport with people, talk to all with honesty.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>Procrastination - not doing things at the right time. Not disciplined well enough</li>

<b><b>JOHN 8:12-59: JESUS, THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Jesus never spoke in public without creating controversy. In fact, he
was constantly in trouble! Rather than retreating behind the safety
of a pulpit, Jesus spoke in settings where people were bold enough to
talk back. In this portion of John's story, Jesus makes a series of
claims about himself. Each claim is met by a challenge from his
enemies. Each challenge is then answered, and the answer leads to the
next claim. Throughout this interchange, Jesus shows us how to speak
the truth in the face of hostility. He also reveals some amazing
things about himself.

wanted to kill him for his message. They misunderstood him

<b><b>The Pharisees challenge the validity of Jesus’ claim (v. 13). How does Jesus answer their challenge (vv. 14-18)?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Jesus' claims were challenged as he was the only witness to it. Jesus answered back to their challenge:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>He knows where he came from and where he was going, but the Pharisees have no idea about it.</li>

<li>They judge by human standards but Jesus was not judging anyone.</li>

<li>Judging by human standards, there have to be two witnesses. Jesus has two witnesses: himself and his father. So his claims are valid even by their standards.</li>
</ol>


<p>
<b><b>Jesus' reference to his Father leads to his second claim—that he came from God. How does this claim heighten the tension between Jesus and the Jews (vv. 19-30)?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
There was further dispute about Jesus. They asked him who he was. He told them about how he had come from God and that he spoke only what the Father told him to say so.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Jesus makes another startling claim in verses 31-32: "If you hold to my teaching . . . then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." Why does holding to Jesus’ teaching lead to true knowledge and freedom?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Because Jesus was from the Father and his teachings are not from man. So if we hold to his teachings, we will know the truth and the truth will set us free.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Jesus' opponents also claim to have both Abraham and God as their father. According to Jesus, how does their conduct contradict their claim (vv. 39-47)?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
Since they were looking for ways to kill him they dont know God. Had they known God they would have loved Jesus.

Nothing is more humiliating than being caught in an act of
disobedience! Whether it's a child with his hand in the cookie jar or
an adult driving over the speed limit, we all know the sinking
feeling of being caught. In John 8, a woman is caught in the most

<b><b>What do we know about the character and motives of those who bring this woman to Jesus?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
They were a bunch of self-righteous people who think the woman caught
in adultery was greater sinner than them. Even worse is the fact that
they used her to trap Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>While it is obvious that the woman is guilty, what elements of injustice can you find in this situation?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
If they thought that she was guilty and deserved to be stoned to death
as the Law of Moses required, there was no reason to bring her to
Jesus. They could have executed her themselves. They somehow want to
put the blame on Jesus or put him in a difficult situation.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>The Pharisees and teachers were often very self-righteous. Why do you think they went away rather than stoning the woman (vv. 7-9)?</b></b>
</p>

<p>
They went away because non of them was without sin. In today's
culture, the people might have still pressed for some other means to
trap Jesus. Here the people left, which is better than the world today
(my opinion).
</p>

<p>
<b><b>How would you describe Jesus' attitude toward the woman (vv. 10-11)?</b></b>

Jesus loves the sinner. His sinless, he hates sin but not the sinner. He wants her to sin no more.

<p>
Not long ago I had a series of conversations with a young man about
Jesus Christ and why faith in him is so important. At first, the
young man was interested. He was open to listen to God’s Word and to
consider Christ’s claims. As time went on, however, he became more
and more hostile to Christ. Finally, he told me that he didn’t want
to pursue his investigation any further. He had decided to reject
Christ and his offer of salvation.
</p>

<p>
That is precisely the pattern that John traces in his Gospel. In the
early chapters, men and women responded to Jesus with belief. Then
some of those who were following him turned away. Now open warfare
breaks out between Jesus and his enemies—and yet, some still seek the
truth. This chapter will help you respond positively to the wide
variety of attitudes toward Jesus today.

Do you realize that during your lifetime you will probably spend over
thirty-five thousand hours eating? That's the equivalent of eight
years of nonstop meals, twelve hours a day! The problem, of course,
is that even after a big meal we get hungry again. At best, food only
satisfies us for a few hours.

Yet in this chapter, Jesus offers us food that satisfies our hunger
forever. You can't buy it in a grocery store. It is found only in

<p>
Throughout the book of Joshua the Lord has demonstrated his
faithfulness and his power. Every promise he made was fulfilled; every
battle he fought was won. Now at the conclusion of the book he asks
Israel and us to reaffirm the most important decision of our lives:
"Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve" (v. 15).

<b><b>Why do you think the Lord recounts Israel's history from beginning to end (vv. 1-13)?</b></b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It recounts Israel's journey from their ancestor of long ago,
Abraham to the day they possessed the Promised Land.</li>
<li>How God has been faithful in keeping his promises to Abraham, Issac
and Israel</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b><b>Joshua and the Israelites repeat the word serve thirteen times in verses 14-27. Why is this a good word to describe our duty to God?</b></b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Either we serve the Lord or serve someone/something else. It is ours
to choose whom we serve.</li>
<li>Our duty is to serve and obey the Lord. We are his servants. What
better word than "serve" to describe our duty to Him.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b><b>Why might serving the Lord seem undesirable to the Israelites (v. 15)?</b></b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Serving the Lord might seem undesirable as the grass seems to be
greener on the other side. When Israel sees the gods of their past
and of their present neighbors, they might think it seems more
desirable to serve other gods.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b><b>Why doesn't Joshua accept the Israelites' first pledge to serve the Lord (v. 19)?</b></b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Joshua is reminding them that serving the Lord is not easy. In fact
we are not able to since He is a holy God, jealous God and will not
forgive our rebellion and sins if we forsake him.</li>
<li>He wants to make sure that the people really meant what they say
about serving the Lord</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b><b>What is the purpose of the witnesses mentioned in verses 22 and 27?</b></b>

the book of Joshua.</a>
</p>

<p>
The tribes which had been given land on the east side of the Jordan
had fulfilled their commitment to the rest of Israel. They had entered
the Promised Land with the others and had helped them to fight. Now it
was time for them to return to their own homes. But since the
Israelites would be living on both sides of the river, the Jordan Rift
Valley became a natural barrier which hindered the unity of the twelve
tribes. Could Israel still remain unified? Their response to a
national crisis illustrates principles for maintaining Christian
unity.

<b><b>Why were the western tribes prepared to do battle over the issue of the altar (vv. 10-20; see also Deut 12:1-14)?</b></b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They thought the tribes across the Jordan had rebelled against the Lord by building an altar for themselves. The Lord had not tolerated sin in the lives of Israel. So they wanted to root out the evil from their midst.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b><b>What reasons did the eastern tribes have for building the altar (vv. 21-29)?</b></b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The eastern tribes replied that their intention was quite the opposite of building an altar for themselves. The altar was to be a reminder to them and the western tribes that the eastern tribes also have a share in the Lord. The altar was a replica of the Lord to stand as witness that they also have share in the Lord.</li>

How does faith differ from wishful thinking? Why should we expect God
to answer our prayers, to provide us with food and clothing, or to be
involved in jobs or family? How do we know our faith isn't simply
foolishness? Scripture tells us that true faith must be grounded in
God's promises. If God has promised to do something, then we can trust
him wholeheartedly. If he has not promised to do something, then all
the faith in the world won't make it happen. In Joshua 20—21 we see
the final outcome of God's promises to Israel.

"I love humanity; it's people I can’t stand!" Those well-known words
from a member of the "Peanuts" gang still make us chuckle. But our
smiles hide the fact that we sometimes feel exactly like that. John
says very little about Jesus’ contact with the multitudes. But long
sections of the Gospel are devoted to conversations Jesus had with
individuals. In John 4 we see Jesus reach out first to a woman, then
to his disciples, and finally to a grieving father. Watching Jesus
give himself to people with love and compassion will help us care for
those God puts in our paths.

Christians often feel more like captives than conquerors. What hinders
our spiritual progress? Why do we sometimes experience so little when
we are promised so much? God had proven himself to Israel throughout
their many battles. He had promised to be with them in the conquest of
Canaan and had kept his promise. Yet in spite of many victories, much
of the land remained to be conquered. These chapters look at why
Israel had failed to possess all that God had promised.

God demonstrates his faithfulness to every Christian. He strengthens
us when we are weak, comforts us when we are suffering, heals us when
we are sick. He provides for all of our physical, emotional and
spiritual needs. After all this, why do we often find it difficult to
trust him? Joshua and Israel had miraculously crossed the Jordan and
conquered the cities of Jericho and Ai. Yet in spite of these
victories, they still needed to be reassured that God was with them.

Success can lead to complacency. We feel confident, in control,
optimistic—then suddenly the bottom drops out of our lives. Israel had
tasted success. They had entered the Promised Land, they had won an
important battle, and God was obviously with them. Conquering the city
of Ai would be a piece of cake! But their confidence collapsed when
they attacked the city and were routed. What had gone wrong? Had God
failed them? Why hadn't God kept his promise?

After I had given a presentation on the claims of Christ, a skeptical student

People have been asking that question for two thousand years! For John the
convincing proof of Jesus’ deity was found in his words and deeds. No one but
God could say the things Jesus said, and no one but God could do the things
Jesus did. In this chapter are two signs that demonstrate that Jesus was the

It was a great day in our history when a man first walked on the moon. But the Bible declares that a far greater event took place two thousand years ago. God walked on the earth in the person of Jesus Christ. John opens his Gospel with a beautiful hymn of exaltation to Christ. It is one of the most profound passages in all the Bible. It is written in simple, straightforward language, yet in studying the depths of its meaning, it is a passage where we never reach bottom. It is an ocean-sized truth, and we have to be content to paddle around in shallow water.
